    You should build according to the instructions at https://gist.github.com/985173.
    
    This recipe will not build everything for you, because WxPython, Matplotlib 
    and Numpy are too difficult.
    
    If it doesn't work the first time, go there and double check your steps. Then
    come back and we'll talk.
